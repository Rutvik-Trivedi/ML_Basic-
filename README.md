# ML_Basic-
******************************************************************************************
This repository is a trial repository for my first machine learning program with python.
The file ML1.py prints out the confidence of the system after getting trained by the linear
regression algorithm.

Along with it, there is also a small self implemented LinearRegression library without
the use of Scikit-Learn named as LinearRegression.py.

Moreover, a self implemented neural network class is also added called Network.py
It has been updated multiple times to get a satisfactory result.
